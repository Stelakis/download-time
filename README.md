Downlaod time information

My app tells you the time needed to download an application or a file based on your download speed

You can change the b varieable to b=a/(your download speed)  

If you dont know what your actual mb/s is i have provided some examples 
Based on your download speed:  
1 Mbps = 0.125 MB/s 
2 Mbps = 0.25 MB/s 
4 Mbps = 0.5 MB/s 
8 Mbps = 1 MB/s 
16 Mbps = 2 MB/s 
32 Mbps = 4 MB/s 
50 Mbps = 6.25 MB/s 
75 Mbps = 9.375 MB/s 
100 Mbps = 12.5 MB/s  
You can find more on www.gbmb.org/mbps-to-mbs
